12-NoSQL-Challenge/Submission
Data Scraping Activity

This activity is the SMU Boot Camp Module 11 Challenge.
All code was resourced from the SMU Boot Camp Class.

Programs used:
Jupyer Notebook
MongoDB Compass

******
Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
Using MongoDB Compass, I created a database called 'uk_food' with collection 'establishments' from the establishment.json.
I used MongoClient to import and confirm the creation of the uk_food database on jupyter notebook.

Part 2: Update the Database
Copying the new restaurant code from the homework, I created a new dictionary for the restaurant. Then using the MongoClient, I update the new document as well as counted, deleted, searche and updated the collection.
